# ü¶¥ Bone Fracture Classification Using Deep Learning

### CSE465 - Pattern Recognition and Neural Network Course Project Content

## üß† About the Project
This project presents a deep learning approach for classifying **bone X-ray images** into two categories: **Fractured** and **Not Fractured**, using **Transfer Learning**.
The primary goal is to assist medical professionals by providing a reliable second opinion to detect bone fractures accurately and efficiently. By leveraging **image-based classification techniques**, the model learns visual patterns associated with fractures, helping to improve diagnostic speed and accuracy.
To achieve robust results, the project utilizes two well-established pre-trained models:

- **EfficientNet**
- **VGG16**

Both models were fine-tuned on a labeled medical X-ray dataset, and their performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics.
