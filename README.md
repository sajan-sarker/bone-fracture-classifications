# Bone Fractures Classification Using Deep Learning

### CSE465 - Pattern Recognition and Neural Network Course Project

#### About the Project:
- The project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify the bone X-ray images into two categories fractured and not fractured using Transfer Learning Approach.
- The primary goal is to assist medical professionals by providing a reliable second opinion for detecting bone fractures. 
- Leveraging image-based classification techniques, the model learns visual patterns associated with fractures and aims to improve diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. 
- The well known pre-trained EfficientNet model and pre-trained VGG16 model was used in this project for classification task for better results. 

#### Dataset:
